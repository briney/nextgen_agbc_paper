# next-generation antigen barcoding
This repository is a companion to our publication  _Efficient isolation of rare B cells using next-generation antigen barcoding_. Although the raw data is available via the SRA, there are additional processed datasets and data processing code for which there are no appropriate respositories. This repo also includes the code and data necessary to reproduce figures from the manuscript.

## data
Raw sequencing data, in the form of paired FASTQ files, is available through the NCBI's Sequencing Read Archive:


Processed data, including datasets used by some of the notebooks in this repository, is available via Zenodo:
